# Bogdan's Ramblings

This is where I host the Jekyll powered blog. Git and Markdown looks like an excellent platform for publishing technology related content.

## Purpose

Ocasionally publish technology related content either in the form of howtos, reviews, quicktips or whatever comes to mind. Besides just having everything in GitHub it would be nice if it could be integrated with other systems at some point.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute technical posts, to submit requests or just share and comment.
