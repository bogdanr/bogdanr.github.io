# Bogdan's Ramblings

This is where I host the Jekyll powered blog. Git and Markdown looks like an excellent platform for publishing technology related content.

## Purpose

Ocasionally publish technology related content either in the form of howtos, reviews, quicktips or whatever comes to mind. Besides just having everything in GitHub it would be nice if it could be integrated with other systems at some point.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:bogdanr/bogdanr.github.io.git
    cd bogdanr.github.io
    gem install github-pages

## How to use it

Build page and start local web server

    jekyll serve
