title: About me 
---

Professionally, I am doing high performance Linux environments for web companies. I work with most major technologies and cloud providers as you can see in [my CV](https://bogdan.nimblex.net/cv/). When you need to handle a lot of traffic or to have good redundancy I am your guy.

If you need help, you also need [my SSH key]({{ site.url }}/id_rsa.pub) and to call +40723372866

As a hobby I like to do electronics projects from which I post almost nothing here :)
