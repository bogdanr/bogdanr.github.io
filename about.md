title: About me

This is a static page. It might be an 'about page' at some point with links and stuff.

Professionally, I am doing high performance Linux environments for web companies. I work with most major technologies and cloud providers as you can see in [my CV](https://bogdan.nimblex.net/cv/). When you need to handle a lot of traffic or to have good redundancy I am your guy.

As a hobby I like to do electronics projects from which I post almost nothing here :)
